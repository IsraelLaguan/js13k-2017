Let's take a look at the algorithm.

It's

## Genetic Algorithm you said?

Genetic programming is quite amazing. It's fun to explain because it relies on knowledge that every body learn in hight school.

It's based on darwin evolution theory: Starting for a population of solution, let's mutate a litle the solution at each generation and keep the best ones.

In order to use it we must:

- Have a way to determine if a solution is better than another.
- Describe the "gene" of a solution, a structure of data of quantified which can be altered.
- Explicit how the solution gene mutate, to result in a slightly different solution.

## data structure

To begin, we must define what is the "gene" of a solution. How do we describe the solution.

For our case, the gene will be an array of disks, each of theses disks have

- a position
- a radius
- a color

Given a certain this data structure, we can draw the image solution.

And from there, we can compute the "fitness" which is value describing how good is the solution.

In our case, the fitness will be derivated from the difference between the target image and the image solution.

# Implementation

We have the big picture, now we let's dive into the implementation details.

Now let's lay the rules:

## How the fitness is computed

Here I compute the color distance for each pixel of the image. And sum the errors.

The distance is a simple euclidian distance in the rbg space.

> We may argue that using a distance which respect the eye spec will be relevant. ( the human eye tends to dicern easily distance between brigth colors than dark ones, or something like that )
> I actually did try and did not had pretinent results.

## How the gene mutate

Is the mutated gene close to the original ( soft mutation ), or is quite different ( hard mutation ) ?

This is a hard question, too close to the original and you may fall into local maximum, too far and you may never converge.

One technic derivated from "recuit simulÃ©" make hard mutation at start to explore the solution space, and as the generation goes, soften them to refine.

This is the solution implemented: after X mutation which does not improve the solution, use soft mutation instead.

The hard mutation either:

- swap a disk with another one
- reset a disk ( select a random color, position, radius )

And the soft one either:

- move the location to a close position
- set the color, to a close one
- alter the radius

## How gene pool is groomed

Should we keep only the better solutions ? How many "bad" solution should we keep ?

Once again this question is about "exploring the space vs refining a solution", with the danger of falling into local maximum or converge slowly.

In our case, the state of the art I found tends to keep only one solution in the gene pool.

I tries myself to use a larger genetic pool, without success.

I implemented a solution with a single element in the gene pool. At each generation, the mutation is either better and used, or worst and discarded. This simplify greatly the algorithm, altought it's not really a genetic algorithm anymore, but something more like hill climbing algorithm.

> Maybe I should have not give up on the genetic aspect this fast.

## Incremental solution

Some algorith I have found use a clever trick. They start with 8 disks, converge to a best solution, then add 8 another disk then converge, ect ...

![incremental solutions](chain.png)

I had better results with this methods. And I got a way to monitor the progress.

Better, I used it to paralelize the algorithm :

- starting from a blank solution, converge to a good solution with 8 disks
- repeat to have N solution with 8 disks
- take the best solution with 8 disk, to work a solution with 16 disk
- repeat to have N solution with 16 disks
- ...

See ? now process can work isolated on making a solution converge. Sharing the result in a common solution tree.

## Cloudify

We have a solution which allows parallelization, let's spend some money on a big machine !

I use a redis cache to store the common solution, and spawn several machine in google compute engine to do the job.

> while lamba calculus seems to be fit here, it is not as the computation take some minuntes, and will likely hit the lambda timeout.

The flow is :

- A process is launched
- It get the solution tree, find a task to do ( take a N solution, make the N+8 solution converge )
- make the solution converge
- write the solution
- repeat

And why not a front to read the solution tree and display the progress ?

![The dashboard](dashboard.jpg)

As you can see, we have several solutions as the tree leafs. I like to human pick the final solution, rather than take the one with the best fitness. To catch that little bit that the machine can't extract if you allows me to say.

# Encoding

We are not done yet!

Remember the goal is to reduce the size of the asset to the minimum. Using JSON file is certainly not an option.

First, one thing I did not tell you is that the disk params are quantified:

- the position is on a 64x64 grid
- the color is contained in a palette of 256 elements
- the color opacity is picked between 4 values
- the radius is picket between 16 elements

So one disk can be encoded as bit array :

```
 #### #### #### | #### #### | #### | ##

    position        color    radius  opacity
```

Which can be concated to represent the whole disk array.

## Binary data in Js

Manipulating binary data is not so trivial in Js.

To do so, I write the binary as a file. It's possible with Uint8Array. With some tricks, I made the file downloadable from the app.

![download adn file](download.gif)

To read it, I use 
```
fetch(fileUrl).then(res => res.arrayBuffer())
```
then it's a simple parsing to retreive the original data.
