Vernissage post mortem
====

This is a post-moterm for a game I wrote for the [2013 js13kgames event](..).

You can play the game [here](..)

# Motivation

The theme was announced on august the 13th, "LOST". I started to assemble things in my mind around this. I wanted to take the opportunity to learn about aframe, since it was a dedicated category this year.

I had this idea to push the limit of the 13k, adding as much as graphical content as possible. Something somehow coupled with the control offered by a VR based game.

It matured in something which takes place in a museum, which will allow me to fit a lot of paintings.

Then naturaly, I rushed into coding the cool stuffs. Leaving the game design things for later.

## post thought

The algorithm I use is not technically a genetic programming.

In a genetic programming, mutation are made on a pool of genes. The way you select the best, and keep the ones that are "not that great but may evolve latter" is critical to maintain a population which will avoid falling into local extremum.

If technically my algorithm is a genetic programming with a pool size of one gene.

Maybe I should have not give up on the genetic aspect this fast.
